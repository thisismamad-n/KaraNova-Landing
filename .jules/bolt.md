## 2024-05-19 - [Broken React Compiler Config]
**Learning:** `next.config.js` had `reactCompiler: true` enabled but the required `babel-plugin-react-compiler` dependency was missing, causing build failures. This feature must be disabled or dependencies installed for the app to build.
**Action:** Always check `next.config.js` and `package.json` for dependency mismatches before attempting to build, especially for experimental features.

## 2024-05-19 - [Canvas Grid Optimization]
**Learning:** The `Squares` background component was using `strokeRect` in a nested loop for every frame, resulting in thousands of draw calls. Canvas API has significant overhead per call.
**Action:** Batch drawing operations into a single path (`moveTo`/`lineTo` then `stroke`) whenever possible, especially for grid-like structures. This reduced draw calls from ~1300 to < 10 per frame.

## 2024-05-19 - [Canvas Animation Optimization]
**Learning:** The `Squares` component was continuously running its canvas animation using `requestAnimationFrame`, even when scrolled completely out of the viewport, leading to unnecessary CPU/GPU overhead on long pages.
**Action:** Implement `IntersectionObserver` in components with continuous canvas loops to pause animations (`cancelAnimationFrame`) when they are not intersecting the viewport, and resume them only when visible.
